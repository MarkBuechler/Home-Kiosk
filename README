Home Kiosk software still in development. You'll need Qt 4.4 to compile and run.
This is old code which I haven't maintained in some years. YMMV. Currently it
controls UPB lighting, has a built-in web browser and has a few other utilities.
I use this Kiosk software on a Linux Atom-based system with a touch screen built in
to my wall
