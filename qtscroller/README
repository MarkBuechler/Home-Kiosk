This is the new kinetic scroller code from Qt 4.8 (master), refactored as an
add-on solution for both Qt 4.7 and Qt 4.6.


Building the libQtScroller library
==================================
Just run qmake "qtscroller.pro" and "make". The result should be a static
libQtScroller.a in lib/ and three built example binaries in examples/.

Please make sure to try out examples/plot/ to get an overview of all the
parameters that are available to influence the kinetic scrolling.


Using the libQtScroller library
===============================
Basically you just add the following line to your project's .pro file:
include(/path/to/qtscroller/qtscroller.pri)
This will take care of setting up the include and library paths as well as
the additional link library.

To use kinetic scrolling in your QWidget based application, using Qt's
standard widgets:
==========
#include <QtScroller>

....

myarea = new QAbstractScrollAreaDerivedClass();
myweb = new QWebView();

// if your device DOES support touch events, please replace
// LeftMouseButtonGesture with TouchGesture!
QtScroller::grabGesture(myarea->viewport(), QtScroller::LeftMouseButtonGesture);
QtScroller::grabGesture(myweb, QtScroller::LeftMouseButtonGesture);
==========

To use kinetic scrolling in your QGraphicsItem based application (or if you
want to scroll non-QAbstractScrollArea derived, custom widgets):
Please take a look at examples/graphicsview/. The grabGesture() call is
always the same, but you have to handle two new events for your own
widgets/graphicsitems: QtScrollEvent and QtScrollPrepareEvent.


Why static?
===========
libQtScroller is only meant to be a short term solution to make kinetic
scrolling available for all Qt applications now instead of when 4.8 comes
around. Please consider it as a bunch of add-on files for your project and
not so much as a library.


WebKit
======
libQtScroller includes kinetic scrolling for QWebView (without overshoot):
this means that all applications using libQtScroller have to be linked
against QtWebKit (qtscroller.pri takes care of this technicality though). 
If you do not want to have that dependency, you have to change
src/qtscrollfilter(.h|.cpp) as well as src/src.pro accordingly.


What happens when Qt 4.8 is released
====================================
Your binary will still work, but they won't magically use the Qt 4.8
QScroller implementation. In order to ensure that from Qt 4.8 nobody is
relying on the solution, we have included some #errors in the headers to
prevent compiling against Qt 4.8.
The proper way is to replace all occurences of "QtScroller" with "QScroller"
and recompile against Qt 4.8. You may need to tweak a few things here and
there if you get build errors (the Qt 4.8 QScroller API is not completely
frozen yet).


Documentation
=============
The API docs are mostly complete and are embedded within the .cpp files as
usual. We do not have an online, HTML version yet.
